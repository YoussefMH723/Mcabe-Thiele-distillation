# Mcabe-Thiele-distillation
McCabe Thiele method is a basic method used to count the number of theoritical trays needed to separate mixture of two components

Model variables that can be edited:
1- Top and bottom composition
2- Fraction of most volatile component
3- Quality of feed
4- Equilibrium data
5- Reflux ratio

Model limits:
1- Can't solve if the reflux ratio < minimum reflux ratio
